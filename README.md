# Simple DevCaminhante PasteBin made in Rust
This project is for my beloved Brazilian IT community inTelegram called [DevCaminhante](https://t.me/DevCaminhante/1) 

Link for the tutorial used 
[Here](https://rocket.rs/v0.5/guide/pastebin-tutorial/)

Basically it's an api build using:
- Rust 
- Rand (Rust Crate)
- Rocket (Web Rust Framework)


## TODO
- Using Shuttle-persist instead of folder upload [here](https://docs.shuttle.rs/resources/shuttle-persist)

- Visual Form to put the code  
- Deletion route  
-  Periodically deletes pastes (24hours)
